## Benefits of This Integration

### Before (External Service)
- ❌ Separate service on different port (5175)
- ❌ Different UI/UX from main app
- ❌ Required opening new tab/window
- ❌ Not integrated with main authentication flow
- ❌ Cluttered navigation bar

### After (Internal Service)
- ✅ Fully integrated within main application
- ✅ Consistent UI/UX with other services
- ✅ Seamless navigation within same page
- ✅ Uses main app's authentication system
- ✅ Clean navigation bar focused on core pages
- ✅ Better user experience with unified service access

## Testing

Created `test_mental_health_integration.py` for automated verification of:
- Health check endpoints
- Status verification
- Authentication requirements
- API connectivity

## Conclusion

The Mental Health Agent is now fully activated and integrated into the main services area. Users can access all mental health features through the "Launch Mental Health" button in the Services page, providing a seamless and unified experience within the main application.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All functions working without breaking existing features
