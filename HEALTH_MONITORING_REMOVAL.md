## 📝 Important Notes

### Health Monitoring vs Health Tracking:
- **Health Monitoring** (`/test-health`): Was a test page for monitoring functionality - **REMOVED** ❌
- **Health Tracking** (`/health-data`): User's personal health data management - **KEPT** ✅

### File Status:
- `TestHealthMonitoring.tsx` still exists in the codebase but is:
  - Not imported anywhere
  - Not routed anywhere
  - Not accessible from UI
  - Effectively "orphaned"
  
- Optional: Can be deleted later if needed, but leaving it doesn't cause any issues

### Navigation Changes:
- Desktop menu: Reduced from 6 items to 5 items
- Mobile menu: Reduced from 6 items to 5 items
- Both menus remain functional and styled correctly
