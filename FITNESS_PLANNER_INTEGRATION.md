## 🚀 How It Works Now

### User Journey:
1. **User navigates to:** Main webapp → Services button
2. **Clicks:** "Launch Fitness Planner" on Health & Wellness Services page
3. **System shows:** Redirect page with loading animation
4. **Auto-redirect:** Opens dedicated Fitness Agent in new tab (http://localhost:5174)
5. **Fallback:** Manual "Open Fitness Planner" button if auto-redirect fails

### Service Architecture:
```
Main Webapp (frontend/)
    ↓
    Clicks "Launch Fitness Planner"
    ↓
    Redirects to ↓
    
Dedicated Fitness Agent:
    • Frontend: http://localhost:5174 (aiservices/fitnessagentfrontend)
    • Backend:  http://localhost:8002 (aiservices/fitnessbackend)
```

## 📋 Service Requirements

### For Fitness Planner to Work:
Both services must be running:

1. **Fitness Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd aiservices/fitnessagentfrontend
   npm run dev
   # Runs on: http://localhost:5174
   ```

2. **Fitness Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd aiservices/fitnessbackend
   python main.py
   # OR
   python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002
   # Runs on: http://localhost:8002
   ```

### Service Status Display:
The redirect page shows helpful information:
- ✅ Expected endpoints (http://localhost:5174, http://localhost:8002)
- 💡 Reminder to ensure services are running

2. **Port Configuration:**
   - Main webapp: typically 5173
   - Fitness frontend: 5174
   - Fitness backend: 8002
   - Make sure no port conflicts

3. **Browser Settings:**
   - Ensure popup blocker allows `window.open()`
   - Allow new tabs from localhost
