# Quick Start Guide - Enhanced Mood Analysis

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your mood analysis system has been completely upgraded with:

1. **7 Mood Categories**: happy, calm, neutral, sad, angry, anxious, stressed
2. **Emoji Support**: Detects 60+ emojis and uses them for mood classification
3. **New Output Format**: `{"mood": "...", "confidence": "high/medium/low", "reason": "..."}`
4. **Batch Content**: Returns 2-3 items when user asks for "more songs", "more jokes", etc.
5. **Games System**: Added games for all 7 moods with recommendations
6. **Enhanced Playlists**: All 7 moods now have curated music playlists

## 🚀 To Test Everything:

### Step 1: Start Backend
```bash
start_backend.bat
```
Wait until you see: `INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8004`

### Step 2: Run Quick Test
Open a NEW terminal window and run:
```bash
python quick_test.py
```

This will test:
- ✅ All 4 examples you provided
- ✅ Mood detection accuracy
- ✅ Emoji support
- ✅ Batch content (multiple songs, games)
- ✅ Output format correctness

### Step 3: Run Full Test Suite (Optional)
```bash
python test_mood_analysis_enhanced.py
```

This comprehensive test checks:
- 10 mood detection scenarios
- All batch endpoints
- All 7 mood playlists
- All 7 mood games
- Error handling

## 📝 Quick API Examples

### Test Mood Detection
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8004/mental-health/analyze-mood ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"text\": \"I feel so good today 😄 everything's going right!\"}"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "mood": "happy",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reason": "Keywords: good, right | Emojis: 😄",
  "suggestions": ["🎉 Keep that positive energy going!", ...]
}
```

### Get Multiple Songs
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8004/mental-health/batch/youtube ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"mood\": \"happy\", \"count\": 3}"
```

### Get Multiple Games
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8004/mental-health/batch/games ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"mood\": \"stressed\", \"count\": 2}"
```

});
const { tracks } = await response.json(); // Returns 3 tracks
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Check if port 8004 is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :8004

# If in use, kill the process or use different port
```

### Test fails with connection error
Make sure backend is running first:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8004/health
```
Should return: `{"status": "healthy"}`

### Import errors
Make sure you're in the project root directory:
```bash
cd c:\Users\Asus\Desktop\healthy_lifestyle_advisor
```

## 📞 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Run quick_test.py** to verify everything works
2. ✅ **Check ENHANCED_MOOD_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md** for full API docs
3. ✅ **Integrate into your frontend** using the API examples
4. ✅ **Test with real users** and collect feedback
