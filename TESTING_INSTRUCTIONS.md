Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8005/mental-health/analyze-mood" `
    -Method POST `
    -ContentType "application/json" `
    -Body $body
```

**Expected Output:**
```json

```powershell
# Test all moods
$moods = @("happy", "calm", "neutral", "sad", "angry", "anxious", "stressed")

foreach ($mood in $moods) {
    Write-Host "`nTesting mood: $mood"
    
    # Get song
    $song = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8005/mental-health/youtube/$mood" -Method GET
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Song: $($song.title) by $($song.artist)"
    
    # Get game

## üé® Testing with Frontend

### Start Frontend
```powershell
# In a NEW PowerShell window
cd c:\Users\Asus\Desktop\healthy_lifestyle_advisor\frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on: http://localhost:5173

### Update API URL in Frontend (if needed)
If frontend is configured for port 8004, update it to 8005:
- Check `frontend/src` for API configuration files
- Change any `localhost:8004` to `localhost:8005`

### Test in Browser
1. Navigate to Mental Health section
2. Type: "I feel so good today üòÑ"
3. Submit
4. Should see: **Mood: happy** with high confidence
5. Should get song/joke/image/game recommendations
