## üìñ Mindfulness Breathing - Full Example

### Benefits:
- Reduces stress and anxiety
- Improves focus and concentration
- Lowers blood pressure
- Enhances emotional regulation
- Clears negative thoughts (even in 60 seconds!)

### Steps:
1. Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit with your back straight and feet flat on the floor.
2. Close your eyes gently or keep them half-open with a soft gaze downward.
3. Begin by taking a few deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.
4. Now breathe naturally. Don't try to control your breath ‚Äì just observe it.
5. Notice the sensation of air moving in and out of your nostrils.
6. Feel your chest and belly rising and falling with each breath.
7. When your mind wanders (and it will), acknowledge the thought without judgment.
8. Gently bring your attention back to your breathing.
9. Continue for 1-10 minutes. Even 60 seconds can help clear negative thoughts.
10. When ready, slowly open your eyes and take a moment before moving.

### Tips:
- Start with just 1-2 minutes if you're new to meditation
- Set a gentle timer so you don't worry about time
- It's normal for your mind to wander ‚Äì that's part of the practice
- Practice at the same time each day to build a habit
- Don't judge yourself for 'doing it wrong' ‚Äì there's no wrong way

## üö∂ Walking Meditation - Full Example

### Benefits:
- Combines physical activity with mindfulness
- Grounds you in the present moment
- Reduces racing thoughts
- Improves body awareness
- Can be done anywhere

### Steps:
1. Select a quiet path that is approximately 10 to 30 steps long (can be indoors or outdoors).
2. Stand at one end of your path with feet hip-width apart, hands resting comfortably.
3. Take a moment to feel your body standing ‚Äì notice your posture and balance.
4. Begin walking at a slower pace than usual, about half your normal speed.
5. Pay attention to the sensation in your feet and legs as you walk.
6. Notice each foot lifting off the ground ‚Äì feel the weight shift.
7. Feel the foot moving through the air.
8. Notice the foot touching back down ‚Äì heel, then toe.
9. Be aware of the weight transferring to that foot.
10. When you reach the end of your path, pause, turn slowly, and walk back.
11. If your mind wanders to thoughts or sounds, acknowledge them and return focus to walking.
12. Continue for 10-20 minutes, maintaining slow, deliberate steps.

### Tips:
- You can walk in a straight line back and forth, or in a circle
- Keep your gaze soft, looking a few feet ahead
- Let your arms swing naturally or hold hands in front/behind
- If you feel dizzy, you're walking too slowly ‚Äì speed up slightly
- Try walking barefoot to enhance sensory awareness
