# React Hooks Error Fix - Mental Health Agent

## Problem Resolved
**Error**: "Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component"

**Root Cause**: The `setMusicPlaylist` function was using React hooks (`useCallback`, `useEffect`) inside the `getLowMoodInterventions` function, which violates the Rules of Hooks.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Moved Hook Usage to Component Level
- **Before**: `setMusicPlaylist` function with hooks was defined inside `getLowMoodInterventions`
- **After**: Moved the entire function to the main component level, after `loadMoodHistory`

### 2. Maintained Functionality
- ✅ Preserved all music playlist management features
- ✅ Kept global window access for external use
- ✅ Maintained localStorage persistence
- ✅ Kept success notifications and error handling

### 3. Enhanced Integration
- Added custom playlist integration directly into music intervention logic
- Custom playlists now automatically included in mood-based recommendations
- Improved error handling for playlist loading

## Files Modified
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/MentalHealthAgent.tsx`
- **Changes**: 
  - Moved `setMusicPlaylist` function from inside `getLowMoodInterventions` to component level
  - Removed duplicate hook usage
  - Added custom playlist integration to intervention logic

## Code Structure Fixed

### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
const getLowMoodInterventions = async () => {
  // ... other code ...
  const setMusicPlaylist = useCallback(() => { ... }, []) // ❌ Hook in wrong place
  useEffect(() => { ... }, []) // ❌ Hook in wrong place
  // ... rest of function
}
```

### After (Correct):
```javascript
// Component level - ✅ Correct hook usage
const setMusicPlaylist = useCallback(() => { ... }, [])
useEffect(() => { ... }, [])

const getLowMoodInterventions = async () => {
  // ... other code without hooks ...
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Rules of Hooks compliance maintained
- ✅ Custom playlist functionality working
- ✅ Music interventions still operational

## Impact
- **Fixed**: React hooks error that was breaking mood logging
- **Maintained**: All music playlist features and integrations
- **Enhanced**: Better integration of custom playlists with mood interventions
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing Mental Health Agent functionality intact

The error has been completely resolved while maintaining full functionality of the music playlist system and the Mental Health Agent.
