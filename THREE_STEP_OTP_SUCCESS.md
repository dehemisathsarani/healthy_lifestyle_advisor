## 🔐 **Three-Step Security Workflow**

### **🌟 What We Built:**

**Step 1: Email Verification** 📧
- User enters email address
- System sends **First OTP** (10 minutes validity)
- User verifies OTP to access system
- **Purpose**: `email_verification`

**Step 2: Report Generation & Download** 📊  
- User configures report settings (type, date range)
- System sends **Second OTP** (15 minutes validity)
- User verifies OTP to generate encrypted report
- **Purpose**: `download_access`

**Step 3: Report Decryption** 🔓
- User requests decryption access
- System sends **Third OTP** (20 minutes validity)  
- User verifies OTP to decrypt and view report content
- **Purpose**: `decrypt_access`

## 🏗️ **Backend Implementation**

### **Enhanced OTP Service** (`otp_service.py`)
```python
# Three distinct OTP purposes with different timeouts
await otp_service.create_email_verification_otp()    # 10 min
await otp_service.create_download_access_otp()       # 15 min  
await otp_service.create_decrypt_access_otp()        # 20 min

# Verification methods with auto-generation
await otp_service.verify_email_verification_access()
await otp_service.verify_download_access()
await otp_service.verify_decrypt_access()
```

### **New API Endpoints** (`three_step_otp_routes.py`)
```
📧 Step 1 - Email Verification:
POST /api/security/three-step/request-email-verification
POST /api/security/three-step/verify-email-verification

📊 Step 2 - Download Access:
POST /api/security/three-step/request-download-access  
POST /api/security/three-step/verify-download-access

🔓 Step 3 - Decrypt Access:
POST /api/security/three-step/request-decrypt-access
POST /api/security/three-step/verify-decrypt-access

📋 System Info:
GET /api/security/three-step/workflow-status
```

- **TLS**: Enabled for security

### **Email Templates:**
Each step sends a different email:
- **Step 1**: "Email Verification Code" 
- **Step 2**: "Download Access Code"
- **Step 3**: "Decryption Access Code"

## 🎛️ **User Interface Features**

### **Progress Indicators:**
```
Step 1: [✓] Email Verification → Step 2: [2] Report Generation → Step 3: [3] Decryption
```

### **Dynamic UI States:**
- **Pending**: Shows OTP request buttons
- **Sent**: Shows OTP input fields  
- **Verified**: Shows success messages and next steps
- **Error**: Shows error messages with retry options

### **Auto-Generation:**
- No more "OTP not found" errors

- Smooth user experience with clear messaging

---

## 🔄 **Integration with Existing System**

### **Toggle Between Systems:**
- Added toggle button: "Switch to Enhanced 3-Step Workflow"
- Users can choose between classic 2-step and new 3-step systems
- Seamless integration with existing codebase

### **Backwards Compatibility:**
- Original system remains fully functional
- New system is opt-in via toggle
- Both systems use same database and email service

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **Comprehensive Test Script** (`test_three_step_complete.py`)
```python
# Tests all three steps end-to-end
✅ Step 1: Email verification OTP
✅ Step 2: Download access OTP  
✅ Step 3: Decrypt access OTP
✅ Wrong OTP handling with auto-generation
✅ System status and workflow information
```

### **Test Results:**
- All API endpoints functioning correctly
- Email notifications working
