# ✅ MOOD LOGS MONGODB STORAGE - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## What Was Implemented

Your mood logs are now **properly stored in MongoDB** with full persistence! Here's what was done:

### 1. Backend MongoDB Models ✅
**File**: `backend/app/models/mental_health_models.py`

Added two new models for storing mood logs in MongoDB:

```python
class MoodActivityModel(BaseModel):
    """Activities within a mood log (jokes, quotes, music, etc.)"""
    id: str
    type: str
    content: Dict[str, Any]
    timestamp: datetime

class EnhancedMoodLogModel(BaseModel):
    """Complete mood log with all user data"""
    id: Optional[str]
    user_id: str              # Links to your user account
    mood_type: str            # happy, sad, anxious, etc.
    mood: str                 # positive or negative
    rating: int               # 1-10 scale
    description: str          # Your notes
    timestamp: datetime       # When you created it
    activities: List          # All completed activities
    factors: List[str]        # Contributing factors
```

### 2. Backend API Endpoints ✅
**File**: `backend/app/routes/mental_health_routes.py`

Created 4 new endpoints to manage mood logs in MongoDB:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/mental-health/mood-logs` | POST | Save new mood log to MongoDB |
| `/mental-health/mood-logs?user_id=...` | GET | Get all your mood logs |
| `/mental-health/mood-logs/{id}` | PUT | Update existing mood log |
| `/mental-health/mood-logs/{id}` | DELETE | Delete mood log |

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Automatic timestamp conversion
- ✅ MongoDB ObjectId handling
- ✅ User-specific queries (you only see YOUR mood logs)
- ✅ Proper error handling with detailed logs
- ✅ Activity arrays properly stored

### 3. Frontend API Service ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/services/moodLogsAPI.ts`

Updated to properly communicate with MongoDB backend:

```typescript
// Save mood log - returns the saved log from database
saveMoodLog(moodLog, userId): Promise<MoodLog>

// Get mood logs - returns array of all your logs
getMoodLogs(userId): Promise<MoodLog[]>
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Returns actual MoodLog objects (not just success/error)
- ✅ Automatic field name mapping (mood_type ↔ moodType)
- ✅ Timestamp conversion between Date and ISO strings
- ✅ Console logging for debugging

### 4. Frontend Component Integration ✅
**File**: `frontend/src/components/EnhancedMentalHealthAgent.tsx`

Integrated MongoDB saving and loading:

```typescript
// Loads mood logs when page loads or user logs in
useEffect(() => {
  loadMoodLogs() // Gets all your logs from MongoDB
}, [user?.id])

// Saves mood log to MongoDB when you click "Complete"
const saveMoodLog = async () => {
  const savedLog = await MoodLogsAPI.saveMoodLog(currentMoodLog, user.id)
  // Updates UI immediately
  setMoodLogs([savedLog, ...prevLogs])
}
```

**Dashboard Update**:
- **Before**: "Total Entries: X mood entries"
- **After**: "Total Mood Logs: X mood logs saved in database"
- **Counts**: Only mood logs (not individual activities)

## How Your Data Is Stored

### MongoDB Collection: `mood_logs`

Each mood log you create is saved as a document in MongoDB:

```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),              // Auto-generated unique ID
  "user_id": "your_user_id",           // Your user account
  "mood_type": "happy",                // The mood you selected
  "mood": "positive",                  // Overall sentiment
  "rating": 8,                         // Your 1-10 rating
  "description": "Feeling great!",     // Your description
  "timestamp": ISODate("2024-..."),    // When you created it
  "activities": [                      // All activities you completed
    {
      "id": "act_123",
      "type": "joke",
      "content": { "joke": "...", ... },
      "timestamp": ISODate("...")
    },
    {
      "id": "act_124",
      "type": "quote",
      "content": { "text": "...", "author": "..." },
      "timestamp": ISODate("...")
    }
    // ... more activities
  ],
  "factors": ["work", "exercise"]      // Contributing factors
}
```

### What Gets Saved Automatically

✅ **Your mood details**: Type, sentiment, rating, description  
✅ **All completed activities**: Jokes, quotes, images, music, games  
✅ **Timestamps**: When you created the log and each activity  
✅ **User ID**: Links log to your account  
✅ **Contributing factors**: Any factors you selected  

## How to Test It

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8005 --reload
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Create a Mood Log**:
   - Go to Mental Health Agent
   - Click "Track Your Mood"
   - Fill in mood details (type, rating, description)
   - Complete at least 1-2 activities
   - Click "Complete"

4. **Verify Storage**:
   - Check browser console: Should see "✓ Mood log successfully saved to MongoDB"
   - Dashboard should show "1 mood logs saved in database"
   - Go to History tab - should see your mood log

5. **Test Persistence**:
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - Check Dashboard - count should still be "1 mood logs saved in database"
   - Check History - your mood log should still be there

6. **Test After Login**:
   - Log out
   - Log back in
   - Check Dashboard and History - everything should persist

### API Test Script

Run the provided test script:

```bash
python test_mood_logs_api.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Test backend connection
- ✅ Save a test mood log to MongoDB
- ✅ Retrieve and display saved mood logs
- ✅ Show MongoDB data structure

### MongoDB Verification

**Using MongoDB Compass**:
1. Connect to your MongoDB instance
2. Find the database (usually `healthy_lifestyle_db`)
3. Click on `mood_logs` collection
4. You should see all saved mood logs

**Using MongoDB Shell**:
```javascript
// Count total mood logs
db.mood_logs.countDocuments()

// View all mood logs
db.mood_logs.find().pretty()

// View mood logs for specific user
db.mood_logs.find({ user_id: "your_user_id" })

// View latest mood log
db.mood_logs.find().sort({ timestamp: -1 }).limit(1)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to save mood log"

**Check**:
1. Is backend running? (`http://localhost:8005/`)
2. Is MongoDB connected? (check backend console for connection errors)
3. Open browser DevTools → Console → look for error details
4. Check backend terminal for error logs

**Solution**:
- Verify MongoDB URI in `backend/.env`
- Ensure MongoDB service is running
- Check if user.id is available (you must be logged in)

### Issue: Mood logs not loading after refresh

**Check**:
1. Are you logged in? (user.id must be present)
2. Browser console - look for "Loading mood logs for user: ..."
3. Network tab - check GET request to `/mood-logs`

**Solution**:
- Log out and log back in
- Clear browser cache
- Check MongoDB - verify logs exist with correct user_id

### Issue: Count shows 0

**Check**:
1. MongoDB query is filtering by user_id
2. User ID in database matches logged-in user ID
3. Mood logs were saved with correct user_id field

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Check in MongoDB
db.mood_logs.find({ user_id: "YOUR_USER_ID" }).count()
```

### Issue: Activities not showing

**Check**:
1. Activities array is populated when saving
2. MongoDB document has activities field
3. Frontend is properly mapping activity data

**Solution**:
- Check browser console when clicking activity buttons
- Verify `currentMoodLog.activities` has items before saving
- Check MongoDB document structure

## What Happens Now
