## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Backend Setup

The Mental Health Agent is automatically initialized when the FastAPI server starts:

```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

Start the React development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access the Application

- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5174
- **Mental Health Dashboard**: http://localhost:5174/mental-health (requires login)

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Testing
Run the included test script:

```bash
python test_mental_health_agent.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. Register/login to the application
2. Navigate to "🧠 Mental Health" in the navbar
3. Test each tab:
   - **Mood Tracker**: Submit mood scores and notes
   - **AI Companion**: Chat with the AI companion
   - **Meditation**: Get personalized suggestions
   - **Wellness Report**: View progress (coming soon)

### API Testing
Use the interactive API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs to test individual endpoints.

## 🔒 Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: All endpoints require valid authentication
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models validate all inputs

3. **Integration**: Connect with wearable devices for real-time data
4. **Notifications**: Push notifications for wellness reminders
5. **Collaboration**: Multi-user features for support groups
6. **Professional Integration**: Connect with mental health professionals

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Initialization Failed**
   - Check database connection
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Review startup logs for specific errors

2. **API Endpoints Not Working**
   - Ensure user is authenticated
   - Check JWT token validity
   - Verify endpoint URLs and methods

3. **Frontend Components Not Loading**
   - Check for TypeScript compilation errors
   - Verify component imports
   - Ensure React dependencies are installed

### Debugging Tips

- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Review FastAPI logs for backend issues
- Use the `/health` endpoint to verify agent status
- Test individual agent functions with the test script

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Agent maintains in-memory data structures for quick access
- **Database**: Consider implementing persistent storage for production
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse

## 🤝 Integration with Existing System

The Mental Health Agent is designed to work seamlessly with your existing system:

- **Authentication**: Uses existing JWT/OAuth2 system
- **Database**: Integrates with existing MongoDB setup
- **Frontend**: Follows existing design patterns and routing
- **API**: Consistent with existing REST API structure

## 📝 Conclusion

The Mental Health Agent is now fully integrated into your Healthy Lifestyle Advisor system. It provides a comprehensive mental wellness platform while maintaining compatibility with your existing architecture. The modular design makes it easy to extend and maintain as your system grows.

The agent successfully implements all the required features:
- ✅ Mood analysis and tracking
- ✅ Stress prediction with risk assessment
- ✅ Meditation and breathing exercise suggestions
- ✅ Journaling with sentiment analysis
- ✅ AI companion chat for emotional support
- ✅ Comprehensive wellness reporting
